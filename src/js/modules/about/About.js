								PassPill is the best way of having all your passwords always available. It makes use of the most advanced encryption algorithms to keep your data secure and accessible only by you, not even us can access to your information.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is not a commercial app but the result of a educational adventure called <a href="https://passpill.io?stay" target="_blank">PassPill Project</a>, that aims to share the development's internals of a modern web application.
							</p>
							<p>
								All the code is open source and well documented, you can have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/passpill-io" target="_blank">github repositories</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								We also write interesting articles, made with â™¥, about the development. We try to cover most of the aspects of creating the application, you can find them in the <a href="https://medium.com/passpill-project" target="_blank">PassPill Project blog</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								The objective of the PassPill Project is sharing knowledge, not monetizing the app, so PassPill is completely free and it has no advertisment. However, if you like the project and you want support it, you can donate to PassPill Project on Patreon. Every <i className="fa fa-dollar-sign"></i> is much and appreciated and keeps the project alive!

								Information privacy, data security and transparency in the way we handle everything are the priorities for PassPill.
							</p>
							<h3>Privacy</h3>
							<p>
								Your passwords are stored in what we call a pill. Your pill is encrypted in the browser and the encryption key is generated from your pass phrase only known by you.
								Neither your passphrase nor the encryption key are sent to our servers, so not even us can access to your information. That means that you are the responsible to keep your pill name and passphrase, if you forget them we won't be able to recovery them and your data will be lost forever.
							</p>
							<h3>Security</h3>
							<p>
								PassPill makes use of <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank">SHA256</a>, the most secure encryption algorithm present in most of the ocassions we need a safe and fast encryption nowadays.
								The app uses a derivation of your passphrase to encode and decode your pill to make the encryption most robust, but the security of your information depends on the selection of your passphrase. If you use a passphrase easy to guess (like your name, the word 'password', or similar) your data is not going to be safe. It's your responsability to choose a phrase that only you know and it's difficult to guess.
							</p>
							<h3>Transparency</h3>
							<p>
								PassPill doesn't want you to trust your information is safe and private, we want you to know it. All the encryption algorithms used are public, like <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/180/2/archive/2002-08-01/documents/fips180-2.pdf" target="_blank">SHA256</a>, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/passpill-io" target="_blank">app's source code</a>.
								The more people can inspect the code, the more secure our systems are going to be and the safer your data is with us.
